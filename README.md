# Factory

Factory is a ruby gem which has the same behavior as Ruby`s [Struct class](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Struct.html). Written as test task for [RubyGarage Courses](http://rubygarage.org/)

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'Factory'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install Factory

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release` to create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
